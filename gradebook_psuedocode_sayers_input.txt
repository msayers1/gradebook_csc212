gradebook.h/gradebook.cpp
    creates a class for the gradebook
    takes the file data and populates the members of the class. 
    
    methods:
        selectionInput(int n){
            Initializes variable for input
            Set a boolean (selection_invalid) to true to represent an invalid input
            Requests integer input from 1 to parameter until selection_invalid becomes false
        gradeInput
            Initializes variable (selection_invalid) for input
            Sets a boolean to true to represent an invalid input
            Requests double input from 0 to parameter until selection_invalid becomes false
        addEntry
            Record new index, id and name of course of new entry
            Add to Gradebook's assignment counter
            Requests total points the coursework is worth
            Requests weight of the coursework
            Asks if the courswork has been completed yet
                If so, a grade is requested
            Requests category of coursework
            Requests name of assignment
            Saves the file after all new information is added to the Gradebook
        record grade
            ask for assignment
            ask for grade
            record grade in assignment
            change entered to 1
            print statement of what was recorded. 
        removeGrade
            Request grade to be removed
            Ask for confirmation of deletion
        report current grade
            pull the grades that have been entered
            calculate grade 
            print the grade statement 
        report final grade
            calculate grade off all entries
            print final grade statement
        give forcast of grade ( maybe a suggestion or take an input of desired grade and reply with the average of the remaining points you need to get.)
            ask for desired grade
            caculate how many points needed for desired grade
            caculate how many points are left
            caculate average of assignment left ( points needed / points are left )
            print needed average statement. 
        printCoursework
            ask for category and report grades in that category
        whatIfReport
            Ask user to input hypothetical grades for each category
            Asks the user if they wish to include the final exam
                If no selected, final exam grade automatically 100 for the calculation
                If yes selected, request a grade
            Calculate the hypothetical final grade with the given values
            Prints grade
            If no final exam inputted, print whether they are exempt from taking it

Main.cpp
//could be pulled out to its own function or tossed in the initialization of the class. 
if file present 
    Read/Load input/data 
else
    prompt user to provide file path or just saw create new file

provide prompt and options
start continous loop 
    take user input
    switch case for user input
        run function for user input
        have a function that exits, kills the program/continous loop
    print prompt and options again

// We should be able to easily modify the read/write files to accomplish this if we stick with space separated data. 
// Make sure name does not have any spaces in it. 
// Grade and Total points will be whole numbers and just add it as a limitation or we can set them to floats/double. The main point is that they are numbers not percentages. 
// But we can leave off class since it will just be one value for this project.
